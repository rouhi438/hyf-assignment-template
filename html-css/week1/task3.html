        <h3>History Of The FIFA World Cup</h3>
        <p>
          The FIFA World Cup was first held in 1930, when FIFA, the world's
          football governing body, decided to stage an international men's
          football tournament under the era of FIFA president Jules Rimet who
          put this idea into place. Jules Rimet was the president of FIFA from
          1921 to 1954. Rimet was appreciated so much for bringing the idea of
          FIFA to life that in 1946 the trophy was named the Jules Rimet Cup
          instead of the World Cup Trophy.[1] The inaugural edition, held in
          1930, was contested as a final tournament of only thirteen teams
          invited by the organization. Since then, the World Cup has experienced
          successive expansions and format remodeling, with its current 48-team
          final tournament preceded by a two-year qualifying process involving
          over 200 teams worldwide. Eventually, FIFA made the decision to stage
          their own international tournament. FIFA president Jules Rimet thus
          set about organizing the inaugural World Cup tournament. With Uruguay
          now a two-time Olympic champion and due to celebrate its centenary of
          independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country. The
          national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team,
          but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long
          and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for the European sides at
          the time of the Great Depression. No European country pledged to send
          a team until two months before the start of the competition.[15] Rimet
          eventually persuaded the national teams of Belgium, France, Romania,
          Hungary and Yugoslavia to make the trip and play the tournament.[16]
          In total, 13 nations took part – seven from South America, four from
          Europe, and two from North America. The first two World Cup matches
          took place simultaneously and were won by France and the United
          States, who beat Mexico 4–1 and Belgium 3–0, respectively.
