# Reflection on Using AI and Copilot

## 1. Identify and share 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task
- AI suggests ideas I might not think of.  
- AI quickly generates initial code structures (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).  
- AI teaches me how to structure and organize code.  

## 2. Where I might have to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions in the future
- I might need to edit code if it doesn’t fit my project’s structure.  
- I might change code to match my own style and keep it clean for the project.  
- I might make small fixes to improve my project.  

## 3. How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner
- Generating code gives me quick solutions.  
- Learning with Copilot explains concepts and reasoning.  
- It helps me understand and improve my own coding skills.

## 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools
- Relying too much may stop me from thinking through problems myself.
- I might not fully understand the code or concepts AI gives me.
- When AI is not available, it may be very difficult for me to solve problems due to high dependency.
